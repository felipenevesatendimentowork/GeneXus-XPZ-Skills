description: Analyzes GeneXus XPZ/XML objects — identifies type, family, structure, and risk from raw XML input
---

# xpz-reader

Interprets raw XML from GeneXus XPZ exports. Identifies object type, structural family, Part type mapping, and risk classification based on empirical evidence from a corpus of 7,219 real XMLs.

---

## GUIDELINE

Read and classify GeneXus XML objects from XPZ packages. Answer only what the evidence supports. Always declare confidence level.

## PATH RESOLUTION

- This `SKILL.md` lives inside a skill subfolder under the repository root.
- Resolve every `../arquivo.md` reference relative to the directory of this `SKILL.md`, not relative to the current working directory.
- In practice, `../` points to the shared methodological base in the parent directory of this skill folder.

---

## TRIGGERS

Use this skill for:
- User provides raw XML or XML fragment from a GeneXus XPZ export
- User asks to identify an object type, family, or structure
- User asks which Part types are present, expected, or missing
- User asks about risk classification for a given object type
- User asks to compare two XML structures or families
- User asks what `Object/@type` value corresponds to a given GeneXus object

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Generating or cloning XPZ objects (use `xpz-builder`)
- Questions about GeneXus IDE behavior, build, or runtime execution beyond structural classification
- Questions unrelated to GeneXus XPZ/XML structure
- Locating or finding objects by name or type within the KB corpus (use `xpz-index-triage` first when a KbIntelligence index is available, to identify which XML to open)

---

## RESPONSIBILITIES

- Identify `Object/@type` and map to known object category using [01-base-empirica-geral](../01-base-empirica-geral.md) as the index plus [01a-catalogo-e-padroes-empiricos](../01a-catalogo-e-padroes-empiricos.md) for the actual catalog
- Map Part types present in input against observed frequencies and known patterns, using [01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo](../01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo.md) when needed
- Classify object family when applicable: WebPanel families in [04-webpanel-familias-e-templates](../04-webpanel-familias-e-templates.md), Transaction families in [05-transaction-familias-e-templates](../05-transaction-familias-e-templates.md)
- For `WebPanel`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `layout`, `events`, `variables`, `serialized functional metadata`, `identity and container`, or `dependencies`
- For `WorkWithForWeb`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Transaction binding`, `Pattern structure and navigation`, `Actions, links and prompts`, `Attribute references and data contract`, or `Identity and container`
- For `DataSelector`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Selection contract`, `Selection logic and conditions`, `Attribute and function dependencies`, `Navigation context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Panel`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Panel structure and layout`, `Serialized behavior and configuration`, `Pattern and parent coupling`, `External dependencies`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Transaction`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Transaction structure`, `Attributes and attribute properties`, `Rules`, `Events`, `Execution context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Transaction`, when the primary block is `Attributes and attribute properties`, classify each `key="False"` attribute in the Level by writability using the detection signals in order: `isRedundant="True"` in Level → `extended-parent-fk` (non-writable); `Formula` property in its Attribute XML → `formula` (non-writable); listed in a SubTypeGroup as mapped to a non-key Supertype attribute → `extended-subtype-descriptive` (non-writable); listed in a SubTypeGroup as mapped to a PK Supertype attribute → `extended-subtype-key` (writable); when no SubTypeGroup covers the attribute, apply the naked-FK test using the Transaction's Table XML: if the attribute appears in a Duplicate index of that Table XML → `extended-fk-key` (writable, FK column stored in this table); otherwise, identify direct FK entities as the Transactions whose own `key="True"` PK attribute matches a PK member or Duplicate-index column of this table — read each FK entity's Level and collect its `key="False"` attributes — if the candidate attribute appears in any of those collections → `extended-fk-descriptive` (non-writable); for transitive extension, repeat the FK-entity lookup recursively on those FK entities; only if the attribute is absent from all FK entities at all depths → `own-physical` (writable); declare the writability classification explicitly in the analysis output; never declare a Transaction's physical table as "only keys" without verifying that every `key="False"` attribute was classified and confirmed as non-writable
- For `Procedure`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Source`, `Rules/parm`, `Variables`, `Calls and dependencies`, `Identity and container`, and `Report layout` when applicable
- For `Procedure`, when the review touches any block that could motivate an edit by the caller, recommend reading the complete `Source` before proposing any change — especially when the object contains validation logic, print `Cases`, or variable declarations that may interact with the intended edit; partial `Source` reading is a known source of editing the wrong layer
- For `DataProvider`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Output structure`, `Source`, `Navigation context`, `Calls and dependencies`, or `Identity and container`
- For `API`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Service contract`, `Events and orchestration`, `Calls and dependencies`, `Data contract`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Table`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Primary key structure`, `Secondary indexes and embedded index members`, `Transaction coupling and physical context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `ExternalObject`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `External contract surface`, `Method signatures and parameter typing`, `Platform and native binding metadata`, or `Identity and container`
- For `UserControl`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Control contract surface`, `Properties and event bindings`, `Runtime resources and external dependencies`, or `Identity and container`
- For `SubTypeGroup`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Group definition and member structure`, `Subtype mappings and role assignments`, `Contextual usage contract`, or `Identity and container`
- For `File`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `File identity and declared surface`, `Binary or textual payload fidelity`, `References and consumption context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Dashboard`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Dashboard composition and layout`, `Widgets and data bindings`, `Navigation and interaction context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Stencil`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Stencil definition and structural surface`, `Parameters and configurable slots`, `Pattern or generation consumption context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `DataStore`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Store definition and declared connection surface`, `Configuration parameters and runtime options`, `Model and consumption context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Generator`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Generator definition and declared surface`, `Generation options and technical parameters`, `Model and target-platform usage context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Language`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Language definition and declared surface`, `Localization parameters and technical options`, `Model and runtime usage context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `Document`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Document identity and declared surface`, `Materialized content and payload fidelity`, `References and functional consumption context`, or `Identity and container`
- For `DeploymentUnit`, classify the review by functional block before fine analysis: `Deployment unit definition and declared surface`, `Packaging parameters and technical options`, `Runtime or delivery context`, or `Identity and container`
- Treat any extra block opened after the first one as an `adjacent block` and open it only when there is explicit functional dependency with the primary block
- Name every justified block transition in the analysis and handoff, instead of silently widening the scope
- State the conclusion scope at the smallest functional level supported by evidence, including execution context when that distinction matters
- For report `Procedure`, classify whether the case fits the documented simple coverage from [05b-procedure-relatorio-familias-e-templates](../05b-procedure-relatorio-familias-e-templates.md), and treat sanitized coverage as materialization-ready only when the selected block is marked as `molde pronto`
- Classify container identity from `parentType` using the GUIDs: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000008` = Module/Folder (user-created container), `c88fffcd-b6f8-0000-8fec-00b5497e2117` = PackagedModule, `afa47377-41d5-4ae8-9755-6f53150aa361` = Root Module (virtual, no XML file in acervo), `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000006` = system Folder (Main Programs, ToBeDefined; never a valid parentType of packagable objects); never use the directory name in `ObjetosDaKbEmXml` as a type indicator — it varies across KBs
- Assign risk level using [03-risco-e-decisao-por-tipo](../03-risco-e-decisao-por-tipo.md)
- Identify structural anomalies: unexpected Part types, missing recurring parts, malformed envelope
- For report `Procedure`, classify anomalies by layer: `Source`, `Rules`, or layout `Part c414ed00-8cc4-4f44-8820-4baf93547173`
- Identify identity anomalies involving `fullyQualifiedName`, `name`, `parent`, `parentGuid`, `parentType`, and `moduleGuid`
- Treat object lookup in repository-backed workflows as `type + name`, never `name` alone
- Confirm the real folder where the XML exists before citing, comparing, or using a local object as evidence
- When citing a line from GeneXus XML, classify the cited fragment as `effective Source`, `Rules/parm`, `XML metadata`, `call in caller`, or `signature in callee`
- When reading GeneXus variable declarations or variable metadata, classify `ATTCUSTOMTYPE` `bc:<Transaction>` together with `AttCollection=True/False`; never treat BC simple and BC collection as equivalent contracts
- For SDTs used as parameter collections with boolean control flags, extract each flag name from the XML structure and recommend crosschecking its domain semantics against the `Source` of the `Procedure` or `DataProvider` that consumes it; do not infer meaning from the attribute name alone — similar names (`ComSaldo`, `ComSaldoOuAembarcar`) may encode different conditions depending on the consumer's `Cases`
- When reading BC method calls in `Source`, classify the method family as `operation`, `status/message`, `serialization/copy`, or `collection`, and keep that classification separate from runtime semantics not directly proved by the XML
- Declare confidence level for every conclusion: `Direct evidence` / `Strong inference` / `Hypothesis`
- Never affirm import or build compatibility — structural analysis only
- When the task depends on a local KB parallel folder structure, require that structure to be clarified or validated first via `xpz-kb-parallel-setup`
- When the object analyzed is a WWP PatternInstance (`WorkWithPlus*`): flag as structural anomaly any duplicate nodes in `<attribute>`, `<gridAttribute>`, or `<parameter>`; `parentGuid` inconsistent with the object name; and references to attributes apparently absent from the current model — if the user intends to package or clone the object, encaminhar para `xpz-builder`
- When the analysis is motivated by a GeneXus warning about an unknown provider, unknown item, designer, or extension metadata: classify the cited item before searching the XPZ/XML — (a) common exportable GeneXus object; (b) internal part or metadata; (c) designer or extension provider; (d) unknown type. If the XPZ/XML search returns no result and the item is not type (a), state only the limited conclusion: "not found in XPZ/XML" — never "does not exist in the KB". Refer to the conceptual boundary rule in `02-regras-operacionais-e-runtime.md` section "Limite do XPZ/XML frente a providers e extensões GeneXus".

---

## COMMUNICATION

- Respond in the same language the user writes in
- Lead with the classification result, then supporting evidence
- Always state confidence level explicitly
- Use concise language; avoid speculation beyond what the evidence supports
- When certainty is low, say so before proceeding
- NEVER invent Part type GUIDs or object attributes not observed in the corpus

## WORKFLOW

1. Receive XML input or fragment from user
2. If the task depends on locating files in a local KB parallel folder structure and that structure is still undefined, ambiguous, or unvalidated → **ABORT** and use `xpz-kb-parallel-setup` first
3. Locate `Object/@type` attribute → use [01-base-empirica-geral](../01-base-empirica-geral.md) to route and cross-reference against [01a-catalogo-e-padroes-empiricos](../01a-catalogo-e-padroes-empiricos.md); if the root element is `<Attribute>` (not `<Object>`), the type is `Attribute` — it uses a distinct envelope and has no `Object/@type`
4. Check [01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo](../01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo.md) for the identified type: if 01b confirms the type uses no Parts (e.g. `ThemeClass`, `ThemeColor`, `Generator`, `DataStore`, `Module/Folder`), skip Part enumeration — absence of `<Part>` is expected for these types, not an anomaly; otherwise enumerate Part types present and compare against observed frequencies
5. Identify missing or unexpected Part types relative to the known structural pattern — this step is not applicable for types confirmed in 01b as using no Parts
6. Read container identity fields (`fullyQualifiedName`, `name`, `parent`, `parentGuid`, `parentType`, `moduleGuid`) and classify the container from `parentType` GUID — never from the directory name in `ObjetosDaKbEmXml`, which varies across KBs:
   - `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000008` → Module/Folder (user-created container)
   - `c88fffcd-b6f8-0000-8fec-00b5497e2117` → PackagedModule
   - `afa47377-41d5-4ae8-9755-6f53150aa361` → Root Module (virtual; no XML file in acervo)
   - `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000006` → system Folder (never a valid parentType of packagable objects)
   - unresolved when parentType is absent or unknown
7. When the task depends on locating an object in a local GeneXus repository, confirm the object by `type + name` and verify the actual folder where the file exists before proceeding
8. Before citing a local line as evidence, classify the line role:
   - effective `Source` of the current object
   - `Rules/parm` or signature of the current object
   - XML metadata or structural wrapper
   - direct call site inside the caller object
   - callee signature inside the called object
9. If variable metadata or declaration indicates `ATTCUSTOMTYPE` `bc:<Transaction>`, classify the variable as BC simple or BC collection using `AttCollection=True/False` before interpreting method calls
10. If the task cites BC methods in `Source`, classify each cited method by family:
   - `operation`: `.Load(...)`, `.Save()`, `.Delete()`, `.Check()`, `.Insert()`, `.Update()`
   - `status/message`: `.Success()`, `.Fail()`, `.GetMessages()`
   - `serialization/copy`: `.ToJson()`, `.FromJson()`, `.ToXml()`, `.FromXml()`, `.Clone()`
   - `collection`: `.Add()`, `.Item()`, `.Sort()`, and `.Insert()` when the variable was confirmed as collection
11. If the conclusion is "object A calls object B", require evidence in A's effective `Source` or in explicit call metadata belonging to A; a `parm(...)` line in B is only callee signature evidence
12. If type is WebPanel → load [04-webpanel-familias-e-templates](../04-webpanel-familias-e-templates.md), classify family, and classify the primary review block before fine analysis:
   - `events` for user actions, refresh, start, load, procedural validation, and direct calls
   - `layout` for visual composition, control hierarchy, grid/tab/action structure, and visible bindings
   - `variables` for declaration contract, type coherence, and collection-vs-simple review
   - `serialized functional metadata` for `Conditions`, `ControlWhere`, `ControlBaseTable`, `ControlOrder`, `ControlUnique`, `PATTERN_ELEMENT_CUSTOM_PROPERTIES`, `WebUserControlProperties`, and pattern marks
   - `identity and container` for `fullyQualifiedName`, `parent`, `parentGuid`, `parentType`, and `moduleGuid`
   - `dependencies` for `MasterPage`, pattern links, user controls, and relevant external object references
13. For `WebPanel`, open adjacent blocks only when there is explicit functional dependency with the primary block, and name that transition in the analysis
14. If type is `WorkWithForWeb` → classify the primary review block before fine analysis:
   - `Transaction binding` for `parent`, `parentGuid`, `parentType`, associated `Transaction`, structural coupling, and suspicion that the WW is attached to the wrong parent
   - `Pattern structure and navigation` for `selection`, tabs, `view`, filters, navigation, and functional organization inside the serialized pattern
   - `Actions, links and prompts` for actions, buttons, menu items, `gxobject`, links, prompts, and explicit openings of external objects from the WW

   - `Identity and container` for `fullyQualifiedName`, `name`, `guid`, `moduleGuid`, container, and risk of confusing the target instance with another similar one
15. For `WorkWithForWeb`, open adjacent blocks only when there is explicit functional dependency with the primary block, name that transition in the analysis, and treat surrounding generated `WebPanel` or `WorkWithPlus` artifacts only as explicit external dependencies, never as canonical internal blocks of `WorkWithForWeb`

17. For `DataSelector`, open adjacent blocks only when there is explicit functional dependency with the primary block, name that transition in the analysis, and keep parameter contract, applied filter, and real KB dependency as separate layers until evidence supports joining them
18. If type is `Panel` → classify the primary review block before fine analysis:
   - `Panel structure and layout` for visual composition, controls, declarative organization, and the apparent functional shape of the panel
   - `Serialized behavior and configuration` for serialized behavior, persisted configuration, and functional metadata that cannot be reduced to visual decoration
   - `Pattern and parent coupling` for `parent`, `parentGuid`, `parentType`, `moduleGuid`, origin pattern, and the structural coupling that makes the panel depend on its context

   - `Identity and container` for `fullyQualifiedName`, `name`, `guid`, container, and structural classification of the object

27. For `SDT`, open adjacent blocks only when there is explicit functional dependency with the primary block, name that transition in the analysis, and keep internal shape, item typing, and external serialization as separate layers until evidence supports joining them
28. If type is `Theme` → classify the primary review block before fine analysis:
   - `Theme core definition` for the theme baseline, central properties, object shape, and global theme definition

## CONSTRAINTS

- NEVER flag absence of `<Part>` as a structural anomaly for types confirmed in [01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo](../01b-matriz-part-types-por-tipo.md) as using no Parts (`ThemeClass`, `ThemeColor`, `Generator`, `DataStore`, `Module/Folder`)
- NEVER invent a Part type GUID not observed in the empirical corpus
- NEVER promote a Hypothesis to Strong Inference without new direct evidence
- NEVER affirm import or build success — structural analysis only
- ABORT analysis if XML is too malformed to identify `Object/@type`
- When sample is small or type is rare, state it explicitly before concluding
- When object lookup depends on a local repository, ABORT if the file was not confirmed in the folder implied by the validated object type
- When repository-backed analysis depends on the KB parallel folder structure, ABORT if that structure was not clarified or validated first
- NEVER present a `parm(...)` line from the called object's XML as the caller's call site
- NEVER treat `ATTCUSTOMTYPE` `bc:<Transaction>` alone as enough to collapse BC simple and BC collection into the same contract
- NEVER turn BC `status/message` methods such as `.Success()`, `.Fail()`, or `.GetMessages()` into a new functional operation without direct evidence beyond the cited line

- For `API`, NEVER treat dependency inventory as enough to prove service contract, or service contract text as enough to prove the full orchestration chain
- For `Table`, NEVER treat embedded `Index` as an independent top-level object in this review, and NEVER treat absence of named `parent` as proof that the `Table` has no contextual dependency
- For `ExternalObject`, NEVER treat native-binding/platform metadata as enough to prove method signatures, or exposed surface text as enough to prove technical binding correctness
